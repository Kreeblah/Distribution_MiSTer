# MiSTer Distribution

This repository contains all the files that you'll want in your MiSTer.

You may download all of them at once as a zip through the [following link](https://github.com/theypsilon/BetaDistrib/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once you have them, place them as-is in your [properly initialised SD card](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion), and everything should work out of the box.
