# MiSTer Distribution

This repository contains all the files that you'll want in your MiSTer.

You may download all of them at once as a zip through the [following link](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Distribution_MiSTer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once you have them, place them as-is in your [properly initialised SD card](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion), and everything should work out of the box.

### Contributing

You are more than welcome to contribute to the [MiSTer-devel Organization](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel). But you can't do it by openening PRs to the main branch of this repository. This repository is only for file distribution. Whatever content shows up here depends on the other repositories of this organization, so you should target your PRs there.

There is a development branch in this repository for the content collection. Is fine to send PRs there but they should only modify the content collection scripts that are being used by the workflows.
